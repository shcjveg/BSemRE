python-joern documentation
==========================

Welcome to python-joern's documentation. Python-joern provides a thin
python wrapper for `the code analysis system joern
<http://mlsec.org/joern>`_ and a library of utility traversals that
can be used to quickly navigate in the code property graph. If you use
joern, you will almost definitely want to install this library as well.
